# Mint.com form clone

A design clone of a the Mint.com sign-up form, as an exercise in html/css, with emphasis on forms and using unordered lists as a layout technique from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/html-forms) full stack web development curriculum. 

The project attempts to duplicate how Mint.com's form appears as of March 28, 2018.  The actual page may change in the future due to redesign by the Intuit team. 

For reference, a screenshot of the actual page is included in this repository
